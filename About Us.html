      <p>Dr. Rita Iglesias, PT,DPT, is a Physical Therapist residing in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. She acquired her Bachelors of Science in Physical Therapy degree from Pines City Colleges in the Philippines in 2000 and completed her Doctorate degree from Utica College of New York in 2015. She has over 20 years of experience in different settings including acute care or hospital setting, sub-acute rehabilitation, geriatric, pediatric and outpatient settings. She served concurrently as a rehabilitation director and physical therapist for more than seven years.

 

        Her acquired skills over the years enabled her to work with various patients with orthopedic, cardiopulmonary, sports and neurologic conditions. Her continuing education credits encompass the following areas: McKenzie courses A-D, Kinesiotaping KT-1, KT-2, Joint Replacement Rehab, Various Sport injuries Rehab and Vestibular Rehab/ BPPV. She is currently working on her Geriatric Specialist Certification.
        
         
        
        After work, she loves to spend time with her two adorable children outdoors, watch movies, bake some pastries and read books.
        
         
        
        Dr. Rita believes that every patient deserves a one-on-one undivided time with their healthcare providers. Albeit the skills and knowledge she has accumulated in the industry, it has always been her strong belief that compassion and quality over quantity  should be consistent throughout. Nothing less.
        
         
        
        During these trying times, COVID-19 has definitely restructured the rehab landscape and with the “new normal” requires utmost patient care and caution. Dr. Rita wanted to be part of this new reality by being able to administer patients’ rehab needs in the comfort of their own homes — thus CompassionFirst Rehab LLC is born.</p>
